# Unsupervised-Fraud-detection-on-bank-transactions

This project focuses on analyzing a financial transaction dataset with the goal of identifying anomalies and potential fraud. 
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank- transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection), contains 2,512 transactions with detailed attributes related to bank accounts, transaction characteristics, and user behavior. 
The analysis aims to detect unusual patterns and suspicious transactions through Feature Engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Clustering, and Anomaly Detection techniques.

In the zip file you can find the dataset, the R-mardown script and also the knitted pdf from R-mardown.
Also a python script in Google Colab is available.
